                <h3>Why cats? - March 12</h3>
                <p>I hate dogs. They're needy, energetic, and annoying... Joking. I just prefer them over dogs. I also want to live my dream of dying as a lonely cat lady who lives in the forest and who everyone calls a witch. Maybe not the lonely part; I still want a partner and a healthy circle of friends. But eh.. I can't really do much when I don't go outside.</p>

                <h3>Neocities - August 9</h3>
                <p>I have now created a Neocities account. But I still need to sleep -_- </p>
                <p>Hopefully everyone's nice here :)</p>

                <h3>Ehhhhhhh....- August 10</h3>
                <p>Revamped it. There will be some problems because I'm a beginner coder, but it's functional..</p>
                <p>Hopefully, I can improve over time when I learn more about web development. If not, then I'll learn how to use FrontPage 2003. I already have it set up in my VM.</p>
                <p>A bit frustrating, though. I spent most of my hours fixing the problem when I originally planned to update the page, and now it's night time... But it is shocking to realize that I just sat and coded when I couldn't even sit in a day-to-day life for a minute. Maybe it's because I like writing.</p>

                <h3>:p - August 22</h3>
                <p>Eh.. a bit busy with school. Also, I don't think I'll be using FrontPage soon; it's difficult to use, surprisingly.</p>
                <p>But you can see that I was supposed to update this on August 10. Now it's August 22...</p>

            <h2>Haircuts</h2>

            <p>Yo. I was just listening to The Dresden Dolls, started dissociating, and my mind derailed to haircuts. Why? Because, as much as I love my wolf cut, I'm starting to get sick of it. Especially since a different person cut it, and now it's too blunt and dull. This is a complete turnaround from just a few months ago when I checked myself out in the mirror whenever I looked. It looked so good and detailed; it made me feel confident. Now, I avoid the mirror.</p>
            <p>Anyways, I'm contemplating whether I should get the Kang Sae-byeok (067) haircut, a pixie cut for a more "masculine" look, or a medium hime cut because, why not? I want to look like a smart, stoic person—or maybe even a bit insane, if you know what I mean…</p>

            <h2>Thinkpads.. for GAMING!?</h2>

                <p>I am in need for recommendations.</p>

                <p>My current laptop is fine for the most part. The integrated graphics are okay, the CPU can handle most of my tasks, and build quality is surprisingly good. The main issue is the RAM—only 8GB and soldered on.</p>

                <p>Why is 8GB not enough for me? It's because I have the attention span of a goldfish—maybe worse—and like listening to music. So I have a lot of tabs open.</p>

                <p>I have long-term problems with lagging and overheating. And while technically, HWInfo64 said it doesn't thermal throttle, I can feel the heat whenever I type.</p>

                <p>I've tried everything like, getting uBlock Origin, using Firefox, toggling HW Acceleration, and even gutting the system, etc—still nothing.</p>

                <p>So, I'm tentatively deciding to sell my current laptop and buy a better one. Looking at Thinkpads, currently.</p>

                <p>These are my requirements:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>at least 1080p IPS</li>
                    <li>16GB minimum</li>
                    <li>PORTS</li>
                    <li>SSD compatible</li>
                    <li>good integrated graphics and CPU</li>
                    <li>the CPU must support Windows 11 (I don't want to use Linux for convenience)</li>
                    <li>upgradable</li>
                    <li>and has great build quality</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These are some games I play:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Little Nightmares I & II</li>
                    <li>Minecraft 1.17.1 (I want to use the latest, though)</li>
                    <li>GTA: San Andreas</li>
                    <li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>
                    <li>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</li>
                    <li>Skyrim</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My budget is around $600. I'm not about to drop $1,000 on a laptop. I mean, if I had $1,000 just lying around, I'd go for the LOQ 15. But the reality is, I'm not sitting on a secret stash of cash. One can only dream of a fairy godmother.</p>

                <p>Anyways, I also don't care much about the keyboard, but I would like something more suited with larger hands. Or maybe I'm just awkward with the way I type. I mean, I <i>am</i> learning how to use 6 of my fingers to type now. Or 8 if you count the thumbs. And while thunderbolt is nice.. it's not necessary.</p>
