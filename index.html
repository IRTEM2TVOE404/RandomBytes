        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone. This is IRTEM, or RandomBytes, and welcome to my website (again). Hopefully, you can enjoy your time.</p>

        <p>Here, you can find my journey through life, Minecraft Beta, music, and some tech-related stuff (i.e., VMs, tinkering, and more.)</p>

        <p>I really love writing and enjoy coding. I sometimes wish I could play an instrument, maybe the electric guitar or piano. But for now, I'm focusing more on adjusting my life to a much "healthier" one.</p>

        <h2>Updates</h2>

            <section class="update">
                <h3>August 27</h3>
                <p>Moved it here because it has a lot of empty space. :p</p>
            </section>


            <section class="update">
                <h3>So...</h3>
                <p>I revamped it again... With more stuff this time, yay!! I think.. ehhhhhh....

                <p>I wasn't really satisfied with the old website. It was originally supposed to be a personal site dedicated to cats, but it got too confusing. The code got too confusing, especially the CSS.</p>
                    
                <p>So, here I am now. I decided to create a template before adding any content. I'm still figuring out the formatting, so please be patient.</p>
                   
                <p>In the meantime, you can contact me. There might be some delays, either on the server or on my part, because I'm trying NOT to be chronically online.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="update">

                <h3>Formatting and Background</h3>

                <p>Still figuring it out. If you have any advice, I'd appreciate it :)

                <p>I am also contemplating whether to use a plain black background or the stars that I found on NASA images. I prefer the plain background because it isn't as harsh on my sensitive eyes.</p>

                <p>But I am proud of myself that it at least looks completed and is not a half-baked, confusing site.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="update">
                <h3>Compatibility</h3>

                <p>Did some things on the background. :)</p>

                <p>Because I looked at my site on my phone and it looked horrendous. So, hopefully the change worked or helped the problem.</p>
